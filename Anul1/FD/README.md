## Description

The goal is to showcase the basic functionality and structure of a to-do list application using the React framework. The POC demonstrates how React can be used to build a dynamic and interactive user interface for managing a list of tasks.
The key objectives of this POC may include:
-	Creating a React component (TodoList) that represents the to-do list application.
-	Managing the state of the to-do items using React's useState hook.
-	Implementing the ability to add new to-do items to the list.
-	Allowing users to mark items as completed or incomplete.
-	Rendering the list of to-do items dynamically based on the state.
By implementing these core functionalities, the POC demonstrates the basic working of a to-do list application using React. It provides evidence that React is suitable for building user interfaces that are interactive, responsive, and easily update their state based on user actions.
